  <h4>Preface</h4><font size="-1">
  <p>With this article, the possibilities of serial communication with 
  peripheral devices via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) will be discussed. 
  More and more serial bus systems are preferred instead of a parallel bus, 
  because of the simpler wiring. As the efficiency of serial buses increases, 
  the speed advantage of the parallel data transmission gets less important. The 
  clock frequencies of SPI devices can go up to some Megahertz and more. There 
  are a lot of application where a serial transmission is perfectly sufficient. 
  The usage of SPI is not limited to the measuring area, also in the audio field 
  this type of transmission is used.</p>
  <p>The SPI (this name was created by Motorola) is also known as Microwire, 
  trade mark of National Semiconductor. Both have the same functionality. There 
  are also the extensions QSPI (Queued Serial Peripheral Interface) and 
  MicrowirePLUS.</p>
  <p>The popularity of other serial bus systems like 
  I<sup><small>2</small></sup>C, CAN bus or USB shows, that serial buses get 
  used more and more.</p>
  <p>Below is a <a href="http://www.mct.net/faq/spi.html#device">list of SPI 
  devices</a>. However this list neither claims to be complete nor is the 
  availablability of the listed components guaranteed. In addition there is a 
  list of <a href="http://www.mct.net/faq/spi.html#manufacturer">manufacturers 
  with the type of SPI components they produce</a>.</p>

  <h3>The Principle</h3>
  <p>The Serial Peripheral Interface is used primarily for a synchronous serial 
  communication of host processor and peripherals. However, a connection of two 
  processors via SPI is just as well possible and is described at the end of the 
  chapter.</p>
  <p>In the standard configuration for a slave device (see illustration 1), two 
  control and two data lines are used. The data output SDO serves on the one 
  hand the reading back of data, offers however also the possibility to cascade 
  several devices. The data output of the preceding device then forms the data 
  input for the next IC.</p>
  <blockquote><img alt="Fig.1" src="mct.net%20%20SPI%20-%20Serial%20Peripheral%20Interface_files/spi1.gif" border="0"> 
    <h6>Illustration 1: SPI slave</h6></blockquote>
  <p>There is a MASTER and a SLAVE mode. The MASTER device provides the clock 
  signal and determines the state of the chip select lines, i.e. it activates 
  the SLAVE it wants to communicate with. CS and SCKL are therefore outputs.</p>
  <p>The SLAVE device receives the clock and chip select from the MASTER, CS and 
  SCKL are therefore inputs.</p>
  <p>This means there is one master, while the number of slaves is only limited 
  by the number of chip selects.</p>
  <p>A SPI device can be a simple shift register up to an independent subsystem. 
  The basic principle of a shift register is always present. Command codes as 
  well as data values are serially transferred, pumped into a shift register and 
  are then internally available for parallel processing. Here we already see an 
  important point, that must be considered in the philosophy of SPI bus systems: 
  The length of the shift registers is not fixed, but can differ from device to 
  device. Normally the shift registers are 8Bit or integral multiples of it. Of 
  course there also exist shift registers with an odd number of bits. For 
  example two cascaded 9Bit EEPROMs can store 18Bit data.</p>
  <p>If a SPI device is not selected, its data output goes into a high-impedance 
  state (hi-Z), so that it does not interfere with the currently activated 
  devices. When cascading several SPI devices, they are treated as one slave and 
  therefore connected to the same chip select.</p>
  <p>Thus there are two meaningful types of connection of master and slave 
  devices. illustration 2 shows the type of connection for cascading several 
  devices.</p>
  <blockquote><img alt="Fig.2" src="mct.net%20%20SPI%20-%20Serial%20Peripheral%20Interface_files/spi2.gif" border="0"> 
    <h6>Illustration 2: Cascading several SPI devices</h6></blockquote>
  <p>In illustration 2 the cascaded devices are evidently looked at as one 
  larger device and receive therefore the same chip select. The data output of 
  the preceding device is tied to the data input of the next, thus forming a 
  wider shift register.</p>
  <p>If independent slaves are to be connected to a master an other bus 
  structure has to be chosen, as shown in illustration 3. Here, the clock and 
  the SDI data lines are brought to each slave. Also the SDO data lines are tied 
  together and led back to the master. Only the chip selects are separately 
  brought to each SPI device.</p>
  <blockquote><img alt="Fig.3" src="mct.net%20%20SPI%20-%20Serial%20Peripheral%20Interface_files/spi3.gif" border="0"> 
    <h6>Illustration 3: Master with independent slaves</h6></blockquote>
  <p>Last not least both types may be combined.</p>
  <p>It is also possible to connect two micro controllers via SPI. For such a 
  network, two protocol variants are possible. In the first, there is only one 
  master and several slaves and in the second, each micro controller can take 
  the role of the master. For the selection of slaves again two versions would 
  be possible but only one variant is supported by hardware. The hardware 
  supported variant is with the chip selects, while in the other the selection 
  of the slaves is done by means of an ID packed into the frames. The assignment 
  of the IDs is done by software. Only the selected slave drives its output, all 
  other slaves are in high-impedancd state. The output remains active as long as 
  the slave is selected by its address.</p>
  <p>The first variant, named single-master protocol, resembles the normal 
  master-slave communication. The micro controller configured as a slave behaves 
  like a normal peripheral device.</p>
  <p>The second possibility works with several masters and is therefore named 
  multi-master protocol. Each micro processor has the possibility to take the 
  roll of the master and to address another micro processor. One controller must 
  permanently provide a clock signal. The MC68HC11 provides a harware error 
  recognition, useful in multiple-master systems. There are two SPI system 
  errors. The first occurs if several SPI devices want to become master at the 
  same time. The other is a collision error that occurs for example when SPI 
  devices work with with different polarities. More details can be found in the 
  MC68HC11 manual.</p>
  <h3>Data and Control Lines of the SPI</h3>
  <p>The SPI requires two control lines (CS and SCLK) and two data lines (SDI 
  and SDO). Motorola names these lines MOSI (Master-Out-Slave-In) and MISO 
  (Master-In-Slave-Out). The chip select line is named SS (Slave-Select).</p>
  <p>With CS (Chip-Select) the corresponding peripheral device is selected. This 
  pin is mostly active-low. In the unselected state the SDO lines are hi-Z and 
  therefore inactive. The master decides with which peripheral device it wants 
  to communicate. The clock line SCLK is brought to the device whether it is 
  selected or not. The clock serves as synchronization of the data 
  communication.</p>
  <p>The majority of SPI devices provide these four lines. Sometimes it happens 
  that SDI and SDO are multiplexed, for example in the temperature sensor LM74 
  from National Semiconductor, or that one of these lines is missing. A 
  peripheral device which must or can not be configured, requires no input line, 
  only a data output. As soon as it gets selected it starts sending data. In 
  some ADCs therefore the SDI line is missing (e.g. MCCP3001 from 
Microchip).</p>
  <p>There are also devices that have no data output. For example LCD 
  controllers (e.g. COP472-3 from National Semiconductor), which can be 
  configured, but cannot send data or status messages.</p>
  <h3>SPI Configuration</h3>
  <p>Because there is no official specification, what exactly SPI is and what 
  not, it is necessary to consult the data sheets of the components one wants to 
  use. Important are the permitted clock frequencies and the type of valid 
  transitions.</p>
  <p>There are no general rules for transitions where data shouls be latched. 
  Although not specified by Motorola, in practice four modes are used. These 
  four modes are the combinations of CPOL and CPHA. In table 1, the four modes 
  are listed.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <table summary="" bgcolor="#eeeeee" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tbody>
      <tr bgcolor="#dadada">
        <th>SPI-mode</th>
        <th>CPOL</th>
        <th>CPHA</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <th>0<br>1<br>2<br>3</th>
        <th>0<br>0<br>1<br>1</th>
        <th>0<br>1<br>0<br>1<br></th></tr></tbody></table>
    <h6>Table 1: SPI Modes</h6></blockquote>
  <p>If the phase of the clock is zero, i.e. CPHA = 0, data is latched at the 
  rising edge of the clock with CPOL = 0, and at the falling edge of the clock 
  with CPOL = 1. If CPHA = 1, the polarities are reversed. CPOL = 0 means 
  falling edge, CPOL = 1 rising edge.</p>
  <p>The micro controllers from Motorola allow the polarity and the phase of the 
  clock to be adjusted. A positive polarity results in latchig data at the 
  rising edge of the clock. However data is put on the data line already at the 
  falling edge in order to stabilize. Most peripherals which can only be slaves, 
  work with this configuration. If it should become necessary to use the other 
  polarity, transitions are reversed.</p>
  <h3>The different Peripheral Types</h3>
  <p>The question is of course, which peripheral types exist and which can be 
  connected to the host processor. The available types and their characteristics 
  are now discussed. Peripheral types can be subdivided into the following 
  categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Converters (ADC and DAC) 
    </li><li>Memories (EEPROM and FLASH) 
    </li><li>Real Time Clocks (RTC) 
    </li><li>Sensors (temperature, pressure) 
    </li><li>Others (signalmixer, potentiometer, LCD controller, UART, CAN 
    controller, USB controller, amplifier) </li></ul>
  <p>In the three categories converters, memories and RTCs, there is a great 
  variety of component. Devices belonging to the last both groups are more 
  rarely.</p>
  <p>There are lots of converters with different resolutions, clock frequencies 
  and number of channels to choose from. 8, 10, 12 up to 24Bit with clock 
  frequencies from 30ksps up to 600ksps.</p>
  <p>Memory devices are mostly EEPROM variants. There are also a few SPI flash 
  memories. Capacities range from a couple of bits up to 64KBit. Clock 
  frequencies up to 3MHz. Serial EEPROMS SPI are available for different supply 
  voltages (2.7V to 5V) allowing their use in low-voltage applications. The data 
  retention time duration from 10 years to 100 years. The permitted number of 
  write accesses is 1 million cycles for most components. By cascading memory 
  devices any number of bits/word can be obtained.</p>
  <p>RTCs are ideally suited for serial communication because only small amounts 
  of data have to be transferred. There is also a great variety of RTCs with 
  supply voltages from 2.0V. In addition to the standard functions of a "normal" 
  clock, some RTCs offer an alarm function, non-volatile RAM etc. Most RTCs come 
  from DALLAS and EPSON.</p>
  <p>The group of the sensors is yet weakly represented. Only a temperature and 
  a pressure sensor could be found.</p>
  <p>CAN and USB controllers with SPI make it easier to use these protocols on a 
  micro controller and inerfacing a LCD via SPI saves the troublesome parallel 
  wiring.</p><a name="manufacturer"></a>
