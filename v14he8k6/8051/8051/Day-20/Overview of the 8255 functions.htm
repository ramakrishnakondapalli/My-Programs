      <p>The Intel 8255A is a general purpose programmable I/O device which is 
        designed for use with all Intel and most other microprocessors. It provides 
        24 I/O pins which may be individually programmed in 2 groups of 12 and 
        used in 3 major modes of operation.<br>
        <br>
        In MODE 0, each group of 12 I/O pins may be programmed in sets of 4 and 
        8 to be inputs or outputs. In MODE 1, each group may be programmed to 
        have 8 lines of input or output. 3 of the remaining 4 pins are used for 
        handshaking and interrupt control signals. MODE 2 is a strobed bi-directional 
        bus configuration. </p>
      <p>The 8255 is a 40 pin integrated circuit (IC), designed to perform a variety 
        of interface functions in a computer environment. The 8255 wasn't originally 
        designed to be connected to the Z80. It was manufactured by Intel for 
        the 8080 microprocessor.</p>

          <td> <b>D0 - D7</b> These are the data input/output lines for the device. 
            All information read from and written to the 8255 occurs via these 
            8 data lines. <br>
            <span class="overlineb">CS</span> (<i>Chip Select Input</i>). 
            If this line is a logical 0, the microprocessor can read and write 
            to the 8255. <br>
            <span class="overlineb">RD</span> (<i>Read Input</i>) 
            Whenever this input line is a logical 0 and the <span class="overline">RD</span> 
            input is a logical 0, the 8255 data outputs are enabled onto the system 
            data bus. <br>
            <span class="overlineb">WR</span> (<i>Write Input</i>) 
            Whenever this input line is a logical 0 and the <span class="overline">CS</span> 
            input is a logical 0, data is written to the 8255 from the system 
            data bus <br>
            <b>A0 - A1</b> (<i>Address Inputs</i>) The logical combination of 
            these two input lines determines which internal register of the 8255 
            data is written to or read from. <br>
            <b>RESET</b> The 8255 is placed into its reset state if this input 
            line is a logical 1. All peripheral ports are set to the input mode. 
            <br>
            <b>PA0 - PA7</b>, <b>PB0 - PB7</b>, <b>PC0 - PC7</b> These signal 
            lines are used as 8-bit I/O ports. They can be connected to peripheral 
            devices. The 8255 has three 8 bit I/O ports and each one can be connected 
            to the physical lines of an external device. These lines are labeled 
            PA0-PA7, PB0-PB7, and PC0-PC7. The groups of the signals are divided 
            into three different I/O ports labeled port A (PA), port B (PB), and 
            port C (PC).</td>

      <p>Two control groups, labeled group A control and group B control define 
        how the three I/O ports operate. There are several different operating 
        modes for the 8255 and these modes must be defined by the CPU writing 
        programming or control words to the device 8255. </p>
      <p>The line group of port C consists of two 4 bit ports. One of the 4 bit 
        group is associated with group A control and the other 4 bit group with 
        group B control device signals. The upper 4 bits of port C are associated 
        with group A control while the lower 4 bits are associated with group 
        B control. 
      </p><p>The final logic blocks are read/write control logic and data bus buffer. 
        These blocks provide the electrical interface between the Z80 and the 
        8255.</p>
      <p>The data bus buffer buffers the data I/O lines to/from the Z80 data bus. 
        The read/write control logic routes the data to and from the correct internal 
        registers with the right timing. The internal path being enabled depends 
        on the type of operation performed by the Z80. The type of operation can 
        be I/O read or I/O write.</p>

      <p>Before going to discuss the detailed description about the usage of the 
        8255 in the MZ-700, you should see the bit definitions of the 8255 control 
        word register (port $E003 of the MZ-700).</p>
      <p>If bit 7 of the control word is a logical 1 then the 8255 will be configured.

      <p>Examples: <br>
        If you want to set/reset bit 0 of port C then set D3 to D1 to 000. <br>
        Bit 1 of port C will be set/reset if you code 001 to D3 to D1. <br>
        Bit 6 of port C is set/reset if D3 to D1 is 110.</p>
